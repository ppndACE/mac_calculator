This project is an experiment with XCode and Objective-C for Mac OS X platform.
Features will be added at random if at all.
UI inspiration taken from the windows calculator (of all things...) and the SHARP EL-520W.

Implemented a variation on the shunting-yard algorithm to parse equations.

UPDATE sept 14, 2013: Unfortunately, I haven't been able to put much work into finishing this project because I got sick during the second half of the summer.
On top of work and school starting up, I regretfully am only starting to work on it again now.

UPDATE sept 17, 2013: Implemented a variation on the shunting yard algorithm to parse the equation.
Instead of using a simple string, I am inputting numbers and operators into an array, so that the equation class just reads numbers separate from operators. 
I'm not sure if this simplified anything or not.

UPDATE sept 22, 2013: Spent a good week on it during my free time, and I think most of the major functionality is there.

UPDATE sept 23, 2013: Finally uploaded to GitHub :)
