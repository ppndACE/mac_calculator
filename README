This project is a simple experiment with XCode and Objective-C for Mac OS X platform.
Features will be added at random if at all.
UI inspiration taken from the windows calculator (of all things...) and the SHARP EL-520W.

So much of this is just hacked together, especially the equations.
- Need to find a better, more efficient way of storing and parsing these equations.

TODO:
- check number then bracket functionality (eg. 1 + 2 ( 3 + 4 ))
	- for this, maybe parse the equation array first to see if there are any numbers
	  preceding a bracket (rather than an operator), and insert a @"*" operator there


UPDATE sept 14, 2013: Unfortunately, I haven't been able to put much work into finishing this project because I got sick during the second half of the semester.
On top of work and school starting up, I regretfully am only starting to work on it again now.
